we will create this magical experience using an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation. Why Red? Sure, we could have used green or any other color also. ALOGRITHM:

1. Capture and store the background frame [ This will be done for some seconds ]
2. Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask. [ used in code ]
4. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect. [ video.mp4 ]
